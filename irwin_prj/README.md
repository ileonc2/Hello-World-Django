# Hello-World-Django

This web app was created using Django framework. In order to start it up you must install django using the "pip install django" command. AFter that you can run it using the "python3 manage.py runserver" command. Once the server is up then head over to a web browser and in the URL line enter localhost:<portnumber>/polls/ to get the message Hello World!. <portnumber> will be replaced by the port number shown in the command line results. In my instance it was port number 8000. My URL looked like this: localhost:8000/polls/.
